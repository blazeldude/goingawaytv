        <p class="thisiswhatitabout">‘Going Away.tv’ is an online platform hosting live streamed artists’ moving image 24/7, combining work from a variety of localities and backgrounds. At once embracing and critiquing the democratic nature of streaming platforms such as ‘Twitch’ and ‘Youtube Live’, ‘Going Away.tv’ will continuously present the work of multiple artists working in moving image and broadcasting, randomised but presented sequentially twenty four hours a day. On returning visits to ‘Going Away’, you may not see the same work twice.<br><br>Existing as a retreat for weary travellers, a destination for new discoveries, the passive nature of viewing is both rewarded and yet indirectly punished. Working with the idea of a dystopian TV station, unable to cope with the new demands of this form of content delivery, the stream becomes distorted and interrupted as viewer numbers grow, gradually turning itself into a community lead abstraction.<br><br>
Engaging with the ideas of solitary versus collective viewing experiences, ‘Going Away.tv’ is a chance for participants to find inspiration in this abstraction while making conscious choices of when and how to view the pre selected programming. As the station’s popularity turns its content into a soup of colour and shape, will you embrace the destruction or search for solitude in its original form.</p>
