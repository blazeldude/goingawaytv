      <h1 class="header">‘Going Away.tv’ is looking for moving image submissions to be part their Wrong Biennale Pavilion and Embassy.
‘Going Away.tv’ is a space for relaxation, an antidote, a place to go to. A new content delivery system, a rolling live stream of artist’s moving image. The choice is made for you already, all you have to do is join in.<br><br>&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;</h1>
      <h2 class="body">'Goingaway.tv' is a new Pavilion opening as part of this year's Wrong Biennale. Curated by Marc Blazel and Alexander Harding in collaboration with Arebyte Gallery, works will form part of an online TV station dedicated to artists moving image. We are looking for videos of any length (the longer the better!) and about any subject matter. Please submit a link to your piece and a short description.
While we are not able to provide a fee we will be extensively promoting you and your work physically and digitally and showing it at our London based Embassy between November 2019 and March 2020. <br><br>&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;</h2>
<h1 class="header">Please send video links along with a brief description and link to your portfolio to goingawaysubmissions@gmail.com
<br><br>
Selected artists will be notified on or before 1st July
Closing date 24/06/19<br><br>&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;</h1>
      <h2 class="body">‘Going Away.tv’ is an online platform hosting live streamed artists’ moving image 24/7, combining work from a variety of localities and backgrounds. At once embracing and critiquing the democratic nature of streaming platforms such as ‘Twitch’ and ‘Youtube Live’, Going Away will continuously present the work of multiple artists working in moving image and broadcasting, randomised but presented sequentially twenty four hours a day. On returning visits to going away, you may not see the same work twice.
Existing as a retreat for weary travellers, a destination for new discoveries, the passive nature of viewing is both rewarded and yet indirectly punished. Working with the idea of a dystopian TV station, unable to cope with the new demands of this form of content delivery, the stream becomes distorted and interrupted as viewer numbers grow, gradually turning itself into a community lead abstraction.
Engaging with the ideas of solitary versus collective viewing experiences, ‘goingaway.tv’ is a chance for participants to find inspiration in this abstraction while making conscious choices of when and how to view the pre selected programming. As the station’s popularity turns its content into a soup of colour and shape, will you embrace the destruction or search for solitude in its original form.</h2>
