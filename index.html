      <p>
        You may remember Going Away.tv, you may not. It came out of us acknowledging
        that within our contemporary media landscape – there is too much choice.
        Goingaway.tv was an antidote to this, where you could log on and tune out –
        we chose the content for you to enjoy. Now we’re asking you to do the same
        for us. Previously a 24/7 stream of Artists’ moving image, our renewed concept
        will take us fully into the live space. We will watch all of your submissions,
        no exceptions. The watching process will itself be streamed live however long
        it takes. For our sanity, all works submitted must be 10 mins or under.
        Moving image, short films, video art - we want to see it all. This time we
        have no choice. We vow to watch every single thing you send. Deadline for
        submission: (two months from posting) Love, The Director Generals
