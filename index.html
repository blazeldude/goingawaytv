          <p>â€˜Going Away.tvâ€™ is an online platform hosting live streamed artistsâ€™ moving image 24/7, combining work from a variety of localities and backgrounds. At once embracing and critiquing the democratic nature of streaming platforms such as â€˜Twitchâ€™ and â€˜Youtube Liveâ€™, â€˜Going Away.tvâ€™ will continuously present the work of multiple artists working in moving image and broadcasting, randomised but presented sequentially twenty four hours a day. On returning visits to â€˜Going Awayâ€™, you may not see the same work twice.</p>
