          <p>â€˜Going Away.tvâ€™ is an online platform hosting live streamed artistsâ€™ moving image 24/7, combining work from a variety of localities and backgrounds. At once embracing and critiquing the democratic nature of streaming platforms such as â€˜Twitchâ€™ and â€˜Youtube Liveâ€™, â€˜Going Away.tvâ€™ will continuously present the work of multiple artists working in moving image and broadcasting, randomised but presented sequentially twenty four hours a day. On returning visits to â€˜Going Awayâ€™, you may not see the same work twice.<br><br>Existing as a retreat for weary travellers, a destination for new discoveries, the passive nature of viewing is both rewarded and yet indirectly punished. Working with the idea of a dystopian TV station, unable to cope with the new demands of this form of content delivery, the stream becomes distorted and interrupted as viewer numbers grow, gradually turning itself into a community lead abstraction.<br><br>
Engaging with the ideas of solitary versus collective viewing experiences, â€˜Going Away.tvâ€™ is a chance for participants to find inspiration in this abstraction while making conscious choices of when and how to view the pre selected programming. As the stationâ€™s popularity turns its content into a soup of colour and shape, will you embrace the destruction or search for solitude in its original form.</p>
